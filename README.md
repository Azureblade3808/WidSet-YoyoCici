# 诺基亚维信 - 悠嘻猴躲避球 Nokia WidSet - Yoyo & Cici Doge Ball

## 介绍 Intro

《悠嘻猴躲避球》是我在2008年外派上海诺基亚期间为诺基亚维信项目中国区编写的维信平台上的一个小游戏。这个游戏由当时大火的IP《悠嘻猴》授权及提供了基础美术设计（人物、背景），由一位当时在上海诺基亚实习的美术设计师（很抱歉忘记你的名字了）和我一起补充了道具设计。游戏的基本玩法由《悠嘻猴》提供，游戏细节主要由我判断把控。

_Yoyo & Cici Dodge Ball_ is a simple game I wrote for Nokia WidSet in China when I worked at Nokia Shanghai as an outsourced developer. _Yoyo & Cici_, a very hot IP in those days, warranted the game and provided basic visual designs(characters, backgrounds). An intern visual designer(sorry for having forgot your name) of Nokia Shanghai and I replenished item designs. Basic game rules were set by _Yoyo & Cici_, and game details were designed and decided by me.

游戏玩法很简单，玩家需要控制“悠悠”或”嘻嘻“左右移动不断躲避天上掉落并不断弹跳的皮球，在生命消耗完之前尽可能获取更多分数。玩家角色在碰到皮球时，会扣除一点生命并消除这个皮球。皮球的数量会随时间增加，并且皮球的弹跳速度会随时间加快。另外会不时有随机道具从天上降落，如果在落地前被玩家角色碰触到，则会触发各自对应的效果。

The gameplay is simple. Player needs to move Yoyo or Cici left or right to avoid bouncing balls from the sky above, and try to obtain as much score as possible before all lives are gone. When the player character is hit by a ball, one life is gone and the hitting ball vanishes. The number of balls grows with time passing, so does the velocity of balls. In other hand, random items will fall from the sky, and if they are touched by the player character, individual effects will be triggered.
